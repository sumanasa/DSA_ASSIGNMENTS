8. The advanced Atlantean city has N buildings. Our superhero Aquaman needs to go from one building in
the city to another. The only way Aquaman can move in the city is through a network of M sharks. Every
Shark can only move from one building to another. Given a query of the form (x, y), find if Aquaman can
reach building y from building x using the network of M sharks. You may be given t such queries. Please note
that if a Shark can move from building x to building y that doesnâ€™t imply that it can also move from building
y to building x.
Constraint:
1 <= N <= 1000
1 <= M <=1000
1 <= t <= 10
1<=x<=N
1<=y<=N
Input:
The first line contains two integers in the order N, M
Given M lines with two building numbers a, b. Each line i represents that the ith shark can move from building
a to building b
This line contains value of the number of queries t
Given t lines with two building numbers x, y
Sample Input:

1 4
1 2
1 3
4 2
4 3
5 1
