3. Given a singly linked list, write a program to shuffle it according to the following rule: segregate all the
elements in such a way that elements at positions k*i (where i starts from 1 and k<=1000, k may not be less
than the number of elements present in the linked list, k may not be a multiple of the number of elements
present in the linked list) appear before the rest of the elements and the remaining elements are appended
in reverse order.
Input:
The first line contains the value of k.
The second line contains the elements of the linked list (The total number of elements present in the linked
list canâ€™t be taken as an input).
Output:
An updated linked list based on the segregation rule described in the problem.
Example:
3
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
Output:
3 6 9 8 7 5 4 2 1
