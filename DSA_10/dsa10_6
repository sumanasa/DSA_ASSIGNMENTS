6. Arya is a huge cricket fan, so he decides that he'll meet his five favourite cricketers in this problem-set of
heaps. And he'll try to impress them. The first cricketer he wants to impress is: Kane Williamson. He asked
Williamson to answer some queries in a press interview. Williamson is irritated by Arya’s constant
interruption during his interview, so Williamson decides to give Sharat a run for his money by asking him the
answer to various queries. Williamson will give a query of the types mentioned below to Sharat and will
expect him to answer those.
Push X -- Insert Williamson's score in an array. - Query type 1.
● Diff -- Find out the difference between Willamson's current highest and current lowest score,
currently present in the array. And then remove a single instance of each of those values from the
●array. - Query type 2.
In case, the current lowest and current highest score are same, then only one instance of that score
will be removed from the array.
● CountHigh -- Find out the number of times Williamson has scored his current highest score, currently
present in array. - Query type 3.
● CountLow -- Find out the number of times Williamson has scored his current lowest score, currently
present in array. - Query type 4.
Input format
The first line contains an integer Q, which denotes the number of queries which have to be dealt by Sharat.
The next Q lines will contain a query like the ones mentioned above.
Output format
For the query types 2, 3, and 4, print the answer in a new line. If there is no record of any innings, that is, the
array of Williamson's score is empty for query type 2, 3 and 4, then print -1.
