9. Hawk Eye is a sharp shooter. He has been training for years before joining as Shield Agent. He has an
ability that helps him to aim long distance targets with pinpoint accuracy. Assuming he is currently standing
on Stark tower and trying to aim at Thanos whose is standing on the last building in that row. He can only
shoot him if the building heights are arranged in a non-increasing order. Thor can help Hawk Eye by
performing 2 operations, either cut the building by one floor or add some junk on the building to increase its
height by one floor. Find the minimum operations needed by Thor.
Input:
The first line contains the number of towers.
The second line contains the heights of the towers separated by spaces.
Output:
The number of operations required.
Example:
Input:
4
