2. Assume that you are managing a pizza store and you have to schedule different pizza requests. Let us
consider that i
th request comes at time ti and take si seconds to be processed.
For example, let us consider that there are three requests that arrive at t1 = 0, t2 = 1, t3 = 2 with processing time
s1 = 3, s2 = 9, s3 = 6. Now, if you apply first come-first serve rule, then request 1 executes first finishing at t
= 3, then request 2 which finishes at t = (3 + 9) = 12 and then request 3 which finishes at t = (12 + 6) = 18.
Remember that when one process is running it cannot be interrupted by any others. Now we define waiting
time for each process as:
Waiting Time = (Time at which the task is done) – (Time at which the task arrived).
So, waiting time of three processes are 3, 11, & 16 respectively. The average waiting time in this case is (3 +
11 + 16) / 3 = 10. This is not an optimal solution. After serving the first customer at time t = 3, you can choose
to serve the third customer. In that case, the waiting time will be 3, 7, & 17 respectively. Hence the average
waiting time is (3 + 7 + 17) / 3 = 9. Given ti’s and si’s, your goal is to find the minimum average waiting time.
Input:
In the first line, you will be given an integer n (number of requests).
In the next n lines, two space-separated integers will be given. The first is arrival time and second is processing
time of each request.
Output:
Minimum average waiting time.
