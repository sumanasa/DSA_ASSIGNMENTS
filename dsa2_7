7. There are N cities with ids {1, 2, 3, 4, â€¦ , N} and N-1 roads connecting these cities. All roads are bidirectional in nature.
Abhishek lives in City 1 so this can be considered as the source. There are M universities in various cities (there is no university in 
City 1). Abhishek gets accepted in all the universities, however, he will take admission in the university which is at minimum distance
from his city. If two or more cities are at the same minimum distance, then he will accept the university which is located in the city 
with minimum id. No two universities are in the same city.  

Input: First line consists of N, i.e. number of cities. Next N-1 lines follow the type u, v which denotes there is a road between u and v.
Next line consists of M. Next M lines indicate ids of cities where universities are located. 
 
Output: Print the id of the city with the university which Abhishek will accept.   
Constraints: 2 <= N <= 100, 1 <= u, v <= N, 1 <= M <= (N-1)
