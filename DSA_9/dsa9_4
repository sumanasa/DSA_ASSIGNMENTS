4. Suppose there is a circle. There are N petrol pumps on that circle. Petrol pumps are numbered 0 to N-1.
You have two pieces of information corresponding to each of the petrol pumps: (i) the amount of petrol that
a particular petrol pump will give, and (ii) the distance from that petrol pump to the next petrol pump.
Initially, you have a tank of infinite capacity carrying no petrol. You can start the tour at any of the petrol
pumps. Calculate the first point from where the truck will be able to complete the circle. Consider that the
truck will stop at each of the petrol pumps. The truck will move one kilometre for each litre of the petrol.
Input â€“
The first line will contain the value of N.
The next N lines will contain a pair of integers each, i.e. the amount of petrol that petrol pump will give and
the distance between that petrol pump and the next petrol pump.
OutputAn integer which will be the smallest index of the petrol pump from which we can start the tour.
