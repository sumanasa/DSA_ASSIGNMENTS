8. Suppose ShareChat will start its IPO soon. In order to sell a good price of its shares to Venture Capital,
ShareChat would like to work on some projects to increase its capital before the IPO. Since it has limited
resources, it can only finish at most k distinct projects before the IPO. Help ShareChat design the best way to
maximize its total capital after finishing at most k distinct projects.
You are given several projects. For each project i, it has a pure profit Pi and a minimum capital of Ci is needed
to start the corresponding project. Initially, you have W capital. When you finish a project, you will obtain its
pure profit and the profit will be added to your total capital.
To sum up, pick a list of at most k distinct projects from given projects to maximize your final capital, and
output your final maximized capital.
Sample Input format

W - current capital
N - number of projects
Profit array
Capital array
