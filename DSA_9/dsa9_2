2. Alexa has two stacks of non-negative integers, stack A and stack B where index denotes the top of the stack.
Alexa challenges Nick to play the following game:
i. In each move, Nick can remove one integer from the top of either stack A or stack B.
ii. Nick keeps a running sum of the integers he removes from the two stacks.
iii. Nick is disqualified from the game if, at any point, his running sum becomes greater than some integer x
given at the beginning of the game.
iv. Nick's final score is the total number of integers he has removed from the two stacks.
Given A, B and x, find the maximum possible score Nick can achieve (i.e., the maximum number of integers
he can remove without being disqualified).
Input -
The first line contains three space-separated integers describing the respective values of n (the number of
integers in stack A), m (the number of integers in stack B), and x (the number that the sum of the integers
removed from the two stacks cannot exceed).
The second line contains n space-separated integers describing the respective values of A.
The third line contains m space-separated integers describing the respective values of B.
Output
Print an integer on a new line denoting the maximum possible score Nick can achieve without being
disqualified.
ExampleInput5 4 10
4 2 4 6 1 (Note the left most element represents the top of the stack.)
2 1 8 5 (Note the left most element represents the top of the stack.)
Output 4
