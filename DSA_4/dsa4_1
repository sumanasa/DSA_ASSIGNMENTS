1. You go to the Egyptian market to get souvenirs for your friends and family. The market has weird rules. It has n different items 
numbered from 1 to n. Each item i has a base cost of a[i] Egyptian pounds. If you buy k different items with indices x1, x2, x3, â€¦, xk 
then the cost of each item is a[i]+xj*k where j varies from 1 to k. In other words, the cost of an item is equal to its base cost in 
addition to its index multiplied by the factor k.
You want to buy as many souvenirs as possible and your budget is S Egyptian dollars. Find the maximum number of items you can buy. In 
case the number of items is same, choose the one with the lowest total cost.
Input:
First line contains n and your total budget S.
Second line contains n different integers each of which denotes the cost of each item.
Output:
Two integers which denote the number of items and total cost you will be spending.
Example:
3 14
2 3 5
Answer:
2 11
Explanation:
You cannot get 3 items because they will cost you [5,9,14] and the total cost would be 28. If you get 2 items, then the items would 
cost [4,7]. So, you can get items costing 4,7 which will cost you a total of 11 Egyptian dollars.
