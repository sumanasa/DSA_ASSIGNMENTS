8. Jon Snow likes Ygritte and decided to propose her. As Ygritte is very shrewd, she decided to give him a
task. She gives him a sorted list of n numbers and rotates it several times. She now asked him to find the
position of number k on the list as fast as possible. Help him to find the love of his life. Solve this problem
using binary search. Assume that index starts from 1.
Constraints:
1<=n<=100000
1<=k<=10000
1<=number on the list<=10000
Input:
This line contains integer n
This line contains numbers on the list
This line contains k
Sample Input:
5
4 5 1 2 3
3
Sample Output:
5
Sample Input:
5
2 4 6 0 1
6
Sample Output:
3
