7. Senti and Panda are best friends. Senti loves cocktails. Senti has decided to rank his favourite n cocktails
based on their price. Panda as a prank decided to swap two adjacent numbers on the ranked order. Senti
got very emotional after that and asked his friend Moggie to order a drink for him for k price and also tell
him its current rank on the new list. Help Moggie to find the current rank. If it is not there on the list return
-1. Solve this problem using binary search.
Constraints:
1<=n<=100000
1<=k<=10000
1<=Price of a cocktail<=10000
Input:
This line contains integer n
This line contains an updated price list
This line contains k
Sample Input:
7
