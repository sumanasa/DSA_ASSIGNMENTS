2. You are trying to solve questions for the DSA lab exam. The question set consists of a large number of
different questions. You are exhausted today, so you decide to solve the problems like this:
You first solve v problems, the drink a cup of tea and solve floor(v/k) problems (where floor() function
returns the largest possible integer value which is less than or equal to the given argument), then
floor(v/(k*k) ), then floor(v/k*k*k) and so on…
The moment the value floor(v/(k^p) ) is equal to zero you stop and go to sleep.
Find the minimum value of v such that you solve not less than n questions.
Input:
Two integers n and k.
Output:
Print only one integer – the minimum value of v that lets you solve n questions.
Example:
7 2
Answer:
4
Explanation:
When v = 4, then he solves the questions like this: 4, 2, 1.
Thus, he manages to solve 4+2+1 = 7 questions.

METHOD 1 :

#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h>
int main(){
    int n,k;
    printf("Enter n & m : ");
    scanf("%d %d",&n,&k);
    for(int v=1; v<=n; v++){
        int p = 0,sum = 0;
        while (pow(2,p) <= v) {
            int a = v/(pow(2,p));
            sum += a;
            p++;
        }
        if(sum == n){
            printf("%d",v);
            break;
        }
    }
}
