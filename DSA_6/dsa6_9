9. Imagine	you	have	a	special	keyboard	with	the	following	keys:
Key	1:		Prints	'A'	on	screen
Key	2:	(Ctrl-A):	Select	screen
Key	3: (Ctrl-C):	Copy	selection	to	buffer
Key	4:	(Ctrl-V):	Print	buffer	on	screen	appending	it after	what	has	already	been	printed.
Suppose you	 can	 only	 press	 the	 above	 mentioned	 four	 keys	 of	 the	 keyboard	 at	 most N times.	Write	 a	
program	to	produce	maximum	numbers	of	A's with	N keystrokes.	That	is	to	say,	the	input	parameter	is	N
(no.	of	times	you	can	press	the	keys),	and	the	output	is	M (no.	of	A’s	that	you	can	produce).
Input:
The	first	line	is N where	N	is	the	number	of	times	key	is	pressed.
Output:
Print	maximum	number	of	As.		Print	-1,	if	N is	greater	than	75.
Constraints:
1	≤	N ≤	75
Example:
Input:
3
Output:
3
Explanation:	Type	3	As	by	pressing	Key	1	3	times.
Input:
7
Output:
9
Explanation:
Key	1	- print	A,	buffer	- A
Key	2	- print	A,	buffer	- AA
Key	3	- print	A,	buffer	- AAA
Key	4	- select,		buffer	- AAA
Key	1	- copy,	buffer	- AAA
Key	1	- paste,	buffer	- AAAAAA
Key	1	- paste,	buffer	- AAAAAAAAA
