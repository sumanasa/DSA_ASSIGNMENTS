3. You	are	a	dog	lover	and	thus	you	don’t	like	cats.	You	live	by	an	unusual	park.	The	park	is	a	rooted	tree	of	
n vertices	with	root	node	as	1.	Vertex	1	also	contains	your	house.	Unfortunately, some	vertices	also	contain
cats	and	you	know	those	vertices.	You	want	to	travel	to	each	of	the	leaves	of	the	tree	starting	from	your	
house.	But	since	you	don’t	like	cats,	if	you	encounter	m consecutive cats	in	your	path	from	your	house	to	a	
leaf	node	then	you	drop	the	path.	
Input:
The	first	line	contains	two	integers,	n and	m — the	number	of	vertices	of	the	tree	and	the	maximum	number	
of	consecutive	vertices	with	cats	that	is	still	ok	for	you.
The	second	line	contains	n integers	a1, a2, ..., an where	each	ai either	equals	to	0	(then	vertex	i has	no	cat),	
or	equals	to	1	(then	vertex	i has	a	cat).
Each	of	the	next	n-1 lines	contains the	edges	of	the	tree	in	the	format	xi,	yi,	where	xi and	yi are	the	vertices	
of	the	tree,	connected	by	an	edge.
Output:	
A	single integer	— the	number	of	distinct	leaves	of	a	tree, the	path	to	which	from	your home	contains	at	
most	m consecutive	vertices	with	cats.
Example:
Input:
4	1
1	1	0	0
1	2
1	3
1	4
Output:
2
